                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.

                <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    A space telescope is a type of telescope that people launch into space to observe stars, planets and galaxies. Since they do not belong to the Earth's atmosphere, space telescopes do not have any distortion from it; thus, they obtain very sharp and wide images of objects within space.

One such spaciously known space telescope is the Hubble Space Telescope. Launched into orbit in 1990, this incredible space telescope has recorded pictures of galaxies and stars light-years away. Space telescopes allow scientists to study the universe in ways they just can't from Earth. They provide us with details on how the universe began, how stars and galaxies were formed, and even hints about distant planets.

In short, it is a space telescope; that is to say, a tool which allows us to see the universe better by positing outside of Earth's atmosphere. It brings fabulous photographs and makes us aware of the mysteries of space.

                <h2>Section 2: Real-World Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    What astronomers do, using space telescopes is not just for viewing the stars; it also has practical applications in the real world. One of the major practical applications that it can aid at is the further study of black holes and distant galaxies. Using a space telescope, it can take pictures of things that may never be seen with Earth's regular telescopes.

Space telescopes also make things easier for us when it comes to tracking the debris in space, which can damage satellites. They help us understand much about space weather, affecting communication systems and satellites. Furthermore, these telescopes are widely used across various fields of science. They help researchers discover new planets and also evaluate the life cycle of stars.

In other words, space telescopes broaden our universe's knowledge while protecting our technology from damage.
