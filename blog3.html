                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.

                <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Doppler Effect occurs when the waves of sound or light from a source change because it is moving. You may have heard this when a car passes with its honking horn-the sound is high pitched as it approaches and low pitched as it recedes. That's the Doppler Effect!

Not only sound waves, but also light waves are applied in this principle. When the star or galaxy approaches us in space, light becomes "stretched out," compressed, and turns blue; it is called blue shift. When the source moves away, the light gets stretched, then red; it is known as redshift.

This effect is employed by astronomers to derive star and galaxy movement. These calculations help in determining how the universe expands. In simple words, the Doppler Effect is how scientists detect movement in space.

                <h2>Section 2: Real-World Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    The Doppler Effect occurs frequently in our daily lives. A widespread application is through speed radar guns of policemen. The device sends its waves against moving automobiles and then compares it with the change in the wave: The speed of the car can be determined.

Doctors also use the Doppler Effect in certain types of ultrasound scanning tests. This enables them to see how blood can move around the body, an application that is as important for detecting blockages as it is for monitoring heart conditions.

In astronomy, the Doppler Effect is used in measuring the motion of stars and galaxies towards or away from Earth. This enables scientists to learn about the rate at which the universe is expanding.
